# amp_ray

My implementation of the ray tracer described in Peter Shirley's excellent Ray Tracing
book series.

NOTES:

Only tested on Visual Studio 2017.  YMMV.

To compile, you'll also need to grab my amp_lib project for math/platform code as well as Sean T. Barret's stb
headers, specifically stb_image_write.h.  They each should be in the code directory.

Each folder has a build.bat script that you can use with VS2017, possibly earlier versions as well.  Otherwise,
it should compile by just passing the cpp file in a folder to gcc/cl.
